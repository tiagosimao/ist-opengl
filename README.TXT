1. How to build
  This project uses cmake and therefore should be buildable in MacOS, Linux or Windows.
  The build.sh script tries to help out with this by running cmake and make in the correct locations

  Install CMake https://cmake.org/download/

  run build.sh

  The built output should appear in bin/

2. How to run
  run.sh

3. How to test
  test.sh
  The tests output log should appear in bin/Testing/Temporary/*log

4. Vector implementation considerations
  Header file at libs/cgj-math/include/cgj-math/vec.hpp
  Implementation at libs/cgj-math/src/vec.cpp
